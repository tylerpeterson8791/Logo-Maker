//  While not a requirement, it is recommended that you 
//place any common functionality and properties shared by the Triangle, Circle, and Square classes in a parent Shape class
// and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.

/*  class Shape
this is the parent this includes letters, lettersColor, shapeName, shapeColor

classes circle, square, triangle all "extend" the shapes class

I need to do more research on how these are rendered and review Gary's examples more to figure out how this works */

//there should be a build shape function that takes the info and builds out the svg with the input
//this needs to be exported at the end.  DONT FORGET
